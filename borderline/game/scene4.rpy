    "The hooded man winced, before spitting something out."

    MC "My friend... you... you!"
    
    "The words lodged themselves in the back of my throat, unwilling to be spoken out into the world."

    "That, perhaps, the tooth belonged to the man, and it was all just a ruse."

    "Was that person even a girl the first place?"

    "My heart felt like bursting, irregularly beating as I tried to regulate my breathing."
    "I wasn’t tired, but I could hardly think as I ran, a quagmire of emotions swirling about in my brain. "
    "Self-loathing, grief, fear, anxiety, frustration."
    "They sank their fangs into my lungs, and they blinded my eyes with a teary veil."
    "The alleyways were merely a mixture of shadows, the moon obstructed by the height of the buildings."
    "I was lost..."
    "and must have dropped my phone along the way."
    "There was no way to call for help, and I wasn’t going to be able to keep up this panicked pace for much longer."

    "Why was I hearing this?"
    "More questions that I couldn’t answer."
    "I stumbled against a wall. The ringing came from the pain, but the howling..."
    "Droplets of blood slipped past my hands as I clutched my nose, trying to stem the flow."
    "It fell onto the asphalt, and I shivered."
    "A blood trail for that monster to follow, a trail of bread crumbs that led to a house of candy."
    "But there would be no powerful witch waiting, only a normal high school boy."
    "Why did I do this alone?"
    "Why, when I had so many friends?"
    "Why couldn’t I just give up?"
    "...because that emptiness in my memories was precious."
