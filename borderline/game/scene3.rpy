    "Her parents were heart-broken, and roamed the city with Missing posters, hoping that someone who knew something would step forward."

    "The day after, she didn’t show up on the news, as if all the hubbub surrounding the case had vanished."
    "It wasn’t that no one cared, as everyone I knew was still talking about it, unable to hide their concerns,"
    "but the media deemed it a piece of news not worth covering."
    "And that pissed me off."

    "On the third day, the police stated that the case was closed, and that the likelihood of finding her now was extremely low."
    "In 48 hours, one can feasibly bring a kidnapped person to any part of the world, after all."
    "The statistics were against them, and there were no easy leads."

    "On the fourth, classmates stopped talking about her."
    "It made sense."
    "They never knew how great of a person she was."

    "It was as if no one cared any longer."

    "They had moved on."
    "The Missing posters were removed."
    "They had totally, absolutely, forgotten who she was."

    "“I have something you need.”"
    "Ah, was this what it was about?"
    "A ransom?"
    "A plan to get rid of me?"
    "Or simply someone who decided that the police shouldn’t get involved?"
    "It was dangerous, but I was the last person in the world who cared about her."
    "Who but I can save her now?"
