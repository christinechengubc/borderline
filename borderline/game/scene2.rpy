    "Five minutes of driving later, the car rolled beside the entrance of Izumo High School."
    
    "Izumi High School was a rather mediocre academic institution, to be honest, but all my friends had wanted me to enroll in this, and so, I did."
    
    "Its walls were aged white, small cracks in the concrete, and it was only three stories high, but the rooftop garden was nice,"
    
    "and it had a surprisingly good reputation when it came to its athletics."
    
    "More importantly, though, other students were still walking into the building, which meant that I wasn’t late!"
    
    MC "Well, thanks a bunch, ojou-sama! See you!"
    
    ## OJ blushes

    OJ "Adieu, my love~ Shall I pick you up again tomorrow?"
    
    MC "Oh, no, it’s fine. Wouldn’t want to be a bother."
    
    OJ "Do not fret, my puppy, for my chauffeur drives me everywhere! A detour wouldn’t matter in the grand scheme of things!"
    
    MC "Eh, you go everywhere by car?"
    
    OJ "Naturally."
    
    MC "Isn’t it bad though? What about the environment?"
    
    ## OJ realized she fucked up lol
    
    MC "And you need to exercise as well, right?"
    
    ## OJ is petrified because she thought the MC just called her fat. lol so fucking over sensitive.
    
    MC "If you want, though, I can show you to a bike shop. That way you can take your detours AND do some light workout!"
    
    ## OJ is saved by the thought of a bike date
    
    OJ "I-is that a date?"
    
    MC "A date? Oh, maybe Saturday afternoon then?"
    
    ## OJ is radiant with joy
    ## school bell rings
    
    MC "Well, gotta go now. Let’s meet by the Park then, alright?"

    "Hopefully, Ojou-sama won’t be late for her own school, but then again, maybe she has private tutors instead?"
    
    "I turn back one more time to wave at her, before sprinting off."
    
    "…"
    
    ## Ojou-sama puts on a Kira face, hand over her face dramatically.

    "The classroom was full by the time I walked in."
    
    "From what I heard, the school had apparently been an all-girl’s high school until recently, and even then, females made up the majority of those that enrolled."
    
    "Taking my seat by the window, I looked across the room."
    
    "She wasn't there."
    
    "Did she get lost? Was she home, sick? No, if that’s the case, she would have texted me."
    
    "I check my phone once more, for any missed calls or text messages."
    
    "Nothing."

    "Well, she should be fine. It’s not like she’s obligated to give me a status update whenever something happens to her."
    
    "…but that would be nice."
    
    "With that, I turned my attention to my books, and got to work."
    
    ## transition to rooftop garden, afternoon

    "Classes had ended for the day, students heading off home. Only a few clubs started activities already, and it’d be a couple of weeks before they truly kicked off."
    
    "The Gardening Club’s fall harvest was just a few weeks from ripening, and already, I could see some zucchinis ready to be plucked. "
    
    "They were large and smooth, their green flesh bursting with the promise of a delicious crunch."

    HRK "They look good, right?"
    
    "I turn to Haruka."
    
    "She was my senpai from cooking club, a reserved, mature girl who had no interest in romance."
    
    "Looked like she had gotten pretty high up on the social ladder in High School."
    
    MC "They do, yeah."
    
    "It was just forced formalities. She had approached me during lunch and told me to meet her at this time."
    
    "It was a bit of a shame that I’d miss out on the opportunity to check out the girl’s tennis club and walk home with a few of the other girls in my class, but it sounded rather important."
    
    MC "So, what’s this about?"
    
    ## Haruka places hand on chin contemplatively
    
    HRK "It’s about Saitama-san."
    
    MC "What?"
    
    HRK "I was dropping off some paperwork in the teacher’s lounge when I heard the vice-principal talking to Fujimoto-sensei."
    
    "My throat felt dry, and I swallowed down my worries. I needed to calm down. Everything was fine. She was just…"
    
    ## Haruka looks concerned
    
    HRK "She’s missing. The police had already visited the house, and have ruled out the possibility that she ran away from home. They’re still deciding whether or not to tell the students about this."
    
    "I couldn’t breathe."
    
    "I needed to calm down."
    
    "Everything was fine."
    
    "No, everything was going to be fine."
    
    ## Haruka looks sad
    
    HRK "I thought you’d want to hear of this first, [fakeMcName.firstName]."
    
    "I tried to smile, tried to show my gratitude, but my face was contorted in a different manner."
    
    "Calm down. Everything was going to be fine."
    
    "But there was no way I was going to be fine with this, huh?"
    
    "I forced down the turmoil and leave, unable to face the facts and the painful expression on her face."
    
    MC "Thank you. And sorry you had to become a bearer of bad news."
    
    "My hand felt numb as I patted her on the head."
