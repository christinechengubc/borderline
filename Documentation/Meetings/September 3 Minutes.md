*See ppt for more details*  
The True God is weaker than the Artificial God  
**Topic put on hold for now**

## Theme Discussion
### Beliefs
- Beliefs that are based on philosophical ways of thought shape who the characters are
- Examples include:
  + Hedonism
  + Solipsism
  + Nilihism
- The main character starts with no belief, and develops varying beliefs based on the decisions of the player.

## Legends System
- People with similar stories/beliefs are approached by the Legends (which 'Gods' are henceforth named)
- Characters act as anchors for the Legends to exist
- Legends are invoked by people, causing them to receive attributes and the ideology of that Legend
  - ex: Fenrir causes the individual's teeth to become sharper, and gives the wielder existence erasure
- Legends are bound to humans by 'contract', upon the agreement of the person
  - Contracts will requires elaboration; different for each Legend
- Overusing the Legends' power will tax the character (mentally and physically)
  - Maybe make the character become lose their humanity/original self

## Setting Recap & Additions
- VN starts in September
- October decided as the month of supernatural events
  - *editor's note: reminds mind of Kagerou Project*
- Extreme events may need to be used to facilitate a large number of Legends happening all of a sudden
- City has an unusual attunement to the power
  - Requires elaboration

## Revisiting the Artificial God/Legend
- God of many faces who does not naturally exist
- Created from urban legends within the city
  - Requires elaboration
